# Practicals

## Brief

This repository is filled with practicals involving python code.
A bit about me, I love basketball and my favourite food is spaghetti :)

## Clean Code

Here are 3 main lessons i learnt about clean code in this subject:

- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- The code should be somewhat readable for everyone to understand
- Ctrl + Alt + L (Autocorrect code)
