# I saw random numbers between 5 and 20(5 and 20 included) as specified in the parameters of randint

# Line 2
# I saw random numbers from 3 upto 10 counting up by 2. Smallest output number is 3 and largest is 9.
# line 2 could not output 4 as we start from 3 and count up by 2, so the next number was 5.

# Line 3
# I found random numbers with upto 16 decimal places that ranged between 2.5 and 5.5.
# The smallest number i could have seen is 2.5 amd the largest is 5.5
